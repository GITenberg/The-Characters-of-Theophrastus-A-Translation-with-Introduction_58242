<p class="dropcap">This translation of <i>The Characters</i>
of Theophrastus is intended
not for the narrow
circle of classical philologists, but for
the larger body of cultivated persons
who have an interest in the past.</p>

<p>Within the last century only three
English translations of <i>The Characters</i>
have appeared; one by Howell (London,
1824), another by Isaac Taylor
(London, 1836), the third by Professor
Jebb (London, 1870). All of
these have long been out of print, a
fact that seemed to justify the preparation
of the present work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>The text followed has been, in the
main, that of the edition published
in 1897 by the <i>Leipziger Philologische
Gesellschaft</i>. A few coarse
passages have been omitted, and
occasionally a phrase necessary to
the understanding of the context has
been inserted. Apart from this the
translators have aimed to render the
original with as much precision and
fidelity as is consistent with English
idiom.</p>

of

<div class="sidenote"><i>Accidental
and Essential
Types</i></div>

<p>“All types of all characters
march through all fables:
tremblers and boasters; victims
and bullies: dupes and
knaves; long-eared Neddies, giving
themselves leonine airs; Tartuffes
wearing virtuous clothing; lovers
and their trials, their blindness, their
folly and constancy. With the very
first page of the human story do not
love, and lies too, begin? So the
tales were told ages before Æsop;
and asses under lions’ manes roared
in Hebrew; and sly foxes flattered
in Etruscan; and wolves in sheep’s
clothing gnashed their teeth in Sanscrit,
no doubt. The sun shines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
to-day as he did when he first began
shining; and the birds in the tree
overhead, while I am writing, sing
very much the same note they have
sung ever since there were finches.
There may be nothing new under
and including the sun; but it looks
fresh every morning, and we rise
with it to toil, hope, scheme, laugh,
struggle, love, suffer, until the night
comes and quiet. And then will
wake Morrow and the eyes that look
on it; and so <i>da capo</i>.” All this is
very true; the changes which may be
observed in human nature are small,
and the old types of Theophrastus
are all about us nowadays and really
look and act much the same as they
did to the eyes of the ancient Peripatetic.
Offices and institutions have
somewhat changed, and many character-types
due to new vocations
have come into being since then,
<i>e.g.</i> the newsboy, the bishop, the
reporter, the hotel-clerk, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
jockey. But these are only accidents
of civilization, and the peculiarities
of office or the type or professional
character do not
touch the vital essence of
human nature, although they may
modify its expression.</p>

<p>When one speaks of a coward, one
means an intrinsic quality in human
kind which is essentially the same
whether found in a hoplite or in a
modern infantryman, but which may
express itself differently in the two
cases. The types described by Theophrastus
are types of such intrinsic
qualities, and his pictures of ancient
vices and weaknesses show men
much as we see them now. They
are not merely types of professions
or callings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Similarity
between
Greek and
Modern
Types</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Flatterer</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Officious
Man</i></div>

<p>Apart from slight variations
of local coloring and institutions,
the descriptions of the
old Greek philosopher might
apply almost as well to the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
inhabitants of London or Boston as
to the Athenians of 300 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Then,
as now, the flatterer plied his wily
trade, indulging in smooth compliment
of his hero’s person or actions. “As
he walks with an acquaintance, he
says: ‘Behold! How the eyes of
all men are turned upon
you! There is not a man
in the city who enjoys so
much notice as yourself. Yesterday
your praises were the talk of the
Porch. While above thirty men
were sitting there together and the
conversation fell upon the topic:
“Who is our noblest citizen?” they
all began and ended with your
name.’” “If his friend essay a jest,
the flatterer laughs and stuffs his
sleeve into his mouth as though he
could not contain himself.” But
the flatterer of old could be subtle
too. “He buys apples and pears,
carries them to his hero’s house, and
gives them to the children, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the presence of their father he kisses
them, exclaiming: ‘Chips of the old
block!’” and “while his talk is
directed to others in the company,
his eye is ever fixed upon his hero.”
Then as now there existed the officious
man, always over-ready to
undertake the impossible or
to interfere in the affairs
of others. “At a banquet,
he forces the servants to mix more
wine than the guests can drink. If
he sees two men in a quarrel, he
rushes in between, even though he
knows neither one.” “If the doctor
leave instructions that no wine
be given the patient, he administers
‘just a little’ on the plea that he
wants to set the sufferer right.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Tactless
Man</i></div>

<p>There existed, of course, then as now,
the tactless person, who “selects a
man’s busiest hour for a
lengthy conference, and who
sings love ditties under his sweetheart’s
window as she lies ill of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
fever.” “At a wedding, he declaims
against womankind, and when a
friend has just finished a journey, he
invites him to go for a walk.” “If
he happens to be standing by when
a slave is flogged, he tells the story
of how he once flogged a slave of his,
who then went and hanged himself.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Mean
Man</i></div>

<p>There was the mean man, too, who,
if his servant broke a pot or plate,
deducted its value from the
poor fellow’s rations. “He
permits no one to take a fig from his
garden or cross his field, or even to
pick up windfalls under his fruit
trees. He forbids his wife to lend
salt or lamp-wicks or a pinch of cummin,
marjoram, or meal, observing
that these trifles make a large sum
in a year.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Thankless
Man</i></div>

<p>There was also the thankless man
whose pessimism is so gloomy as to
cloud all view of his blessings.
“When a friend
has sent him something from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
table, he says to the servant who
brings it: ‘He grudged me a dish
of soup and a cup of wine, I suppose,
and so couldn’t invite me to
dinner.’” “If he secures a slave at
a bargain after long dickering with
the owner, he says: ‘I imagine I
haven’t got much at this price.’
And to the person who brings him
the glad tidings that a son is born to
him, he retorts, ‘If you only add:
“And half your fortune’s gone,”
you’ll hit it.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Petty
Vanity</i></div>

<p>Then we have the man who is ostentatious
in trivial things. “When he
has sacrificed an ox, he
winds the head and horns
with fillets, and nails them up, opposite
the entrance of his house.”
“When he parades with the cavalry
he gives all his accoutrements to his
squire to carry home, and throwing
back his mantle stalks proudly about
the market-place in his spurs.”
When he is master of the prytany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
he craves the privilege of announcing
to the people the result of the
sacrifice; and as soon as he has
delivered to the people the momentous
intelligence that the sacrifice has
resulted well, he hies him home and
recounts his triumph to his wife in
an ecstasy of joy.</p>

<p>The foregoing are but illustrations
of the happy skill with which Theophrastus
has delineated a number of
character-types which are as universal
as human nature and know no limits
of age or of country. Here and
there we meet a type in the Greek
for which we have no exact counterpart
in our customary modern modes
of thought. Such a type may be
seen in Theophrastus’s “The Disagreeable
Man,” a person who seems
a sort of general nuisance with a
touch of the bore and the braggart.
As a rule, however, the types are
singularly like those we know to-day,
and it is not difficult at once to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
them with appropriate modern
labels. The treatment, though almost
invariably brief, is invariably
vigorous and trenchant. With a
few bold strokes the character is
drawn. There is absolutely no pretense
of style, as we ordinarily understand
it; yet each type is in its way
a gem. Through them all runs that
fidelity to truth which was the unfailing
inspiration of all Greek art.
It is this which makes <i>The Characters</i>
a unique creation and vindicates
their position as a part of the world’s
literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Earliest
Attempt
at
Character-writing</i></div>

<p>It is largely for this reason that these
slight sketches are here produced in
English, exhibiting as they do,
when we compare them with
what we see around us, the essential
identity of human nature
in ages widely separated
from each other in time and manners.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
There is, furthermore, an accidental
interest in the work of Theophrastus,
due to the fact that it is the first recorded
attempt at systematic character-writing.
Characters, to be
sure, are portrayed in Homer and
in the tragedians, but they are incidental
to the narrative or to the
dramatic plot, whereas in Theophrastus
the business is with the
delineation of a character as such.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Influence
of Theophrastus</i></div>

<p>He tells us what a man does, simply
as an illustration of what he is, and
this method of writing had a very
intimate bearing on the evolution
of the New Comedy
under the leadership of Menander.
There is a tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
in fact, that Theophrastus was the
teacher of Menander, who in turn
furnished models for Terence in his
delineation of conventional dramatic
types. The influence of Theophrastus
was further directly and
potently exerted on the so-called
character-writers of the seventeenth
century in England and France. The
simple methods of these character-writers
and their uninvolved sketches
were succeeded by the more elaborate
art of the novelists, in whose works
individuals rather than types are described
by exhibiting their development
in long periods of time and
under great diversity of circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His Writings and
Genius</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His Will</i></div>

<p>We have little information as to
the personal history of Theophrastus,
beyond what we learn from
the extant fragments of his
writings and from the meagre
biography of Diogenes of Laërte.
He was born at Eresus, a village on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
the island of Lesbos, in 371 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
and his father was one Melantas, a
fuller by trade. He first went to
school to Alcippus in his native
island, but afterwards travelled to
Athens, the intellectual metropolis,
and became a pupil of Plato at the
Academy, with whom he appears to
have studied until the Master’s death.
Theophrastus was then in his twenty-fifth
year. At that time he attached
himself to Aristotle, who was some
twelve years his senior and who had
also been a member of the Academy,
until Plato died <i>scribens</i>. During
the twelve years which elapsed from
the death of Plato until Aristotle
established the new school
of the Lyceum (in 335 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>),
Theophrastus was probably
with his new leader, at least
part of the time, in Stagira or at the
Macedonian court, where the youthful
Alexander was under the tutorial
discipline of Aristotle. Theophrastus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
was an intimate friend of Callisthenes,
the unfortunate fellow-student and
companion of Alexander, and it is
probable that the two studied together
at Pella. The story is told
that Aristotle, in speaking of these
two pupils, said: “Callisthenes
needs a spur, but Theophrastus,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
a bridle.” Many years later, when
Aristotle was dead and Cassander
(see <i>Character</i> VII.) had gained
control of Alexander’s throne, Theophrastus
was invited to an office at
the court where he had spent his
student days, and Ptolemy Soter,
Cassander’s political ally, sent him
an invitation to the court of Egypt.
But he declined these calls into the
social and political world, and maintained
steadfastly his devotion to philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
It was a fashion for the rectors or
presidents of the great schools of
Athens, such as the Cynosarges,
the Academy, and the
Lyceum, before their death
to name their successors in
office. And so when Aristotle
was asked who should
succeed him in the presidency
of the Lyceum, tradition tells of the
delicate way in which he left record
of his wish. His two most distinguished
pupils were Theophrastus
of Lesbos and Eudemus of Rhodes.
Aristotle replied to the question as to
his successor by asking for two sorts
of wine,—Lesbian and Rhodian.
After tasting of them he said: “They
are both excellent; but the Lesbian
is the sweeter.” Thereby it was
known that he had decided in favor
of Theophrastus, who on the death
of Aristotle (322 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) succeeded to
the presidency of the Lyceum, over
which he continued to preside for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
thirty-five years. His administration
was one of almost unparalleled success.
Diogenes Laertius reports that
two thousand students thronged to
him. Although not born at Athens,
he was one of the most popular and
beloved members of that somewhat
exclusive community. This is illustrated
by the story of Agonides,
who preferred against him a charge of
atheism,—a charge similar to that
which brought Socrates to martyrdom
and drove Aristotle into exile and
caused his early death; but instead
of injuring Theophrastus, Agonides
narrowly escaped paying a fine for
his folly. Amongst his contemporaries
Theophrastus was a great personal
force by reason of his amiable
character, his charities and lavish
benefactions, the amenity of
his manners, his great erudition,
and gifts of oratory.
He died in 287 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> in the eighty-fifth
year of his age, and Diogenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Laertius says that “the whole population
of Athens, honoring him
greatly, followed him to the grave.”
Theophrastus was one of the greatest
polygraphs of antiquity. Two
hundred and twenty-seven
works<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> are attributed to him.
The range of his learning is
similar to that of Aristotle’s, with the
emphasis laid rather more strongly
on the side of natural science. His
genius, however, is not marked by
Aristotle’s profundity. He served
his age rather as a great popularizer
of science; he was not an
originator of epoch-making ideas or
theories. Yet as a local and popular
force he surpassed Aristotle.
His influence on subsequent ages,
however, is less marked. Of the
227 works (containing 232,908 lines)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
attributed to Theophrastus, fragments
of nine only are now extant,
excluding certain insignificant
remains.</p>

<p>It is doubtless true, however, that
he influenced his own time as much
by his administrative ability in the
conduct of the Lyceum and by
his oral utterances as by his written
treatises. His prodigious industry
was no doubt partially inspired by
Aristotle as well as by the swift,
stirring movement of the age immediately
preceding and following the
death of Alexander, in which his literary
manhood was passed. “Time,”
he says, “is the most valuable thing
a man can spend.” He expressed
his sense of the value of order in the
apothegm: “Better trust a horse
without bridle than a discourse without
arrangement.” His estimate of
oral converse at table is recorded in
a rather brusque and un-Athenian
remark said to have been made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
him to a silent neighbor at dinner:
“Sir, if you are an ignorant man,
your conduct shows wisdom; but if
you are a wise man, you act like a
fool.” The genuinely kind character
of Theophrastus, however, is amply
illustrated by the provisions
of his will, which evidences
also his very considerable wealth.
He had inherited from Aristotle the
largest private library then known.
This library, to which he had himself
made notable additions, he
bequeathed to Neleus, his nephew
(Theophrastus never married), and by
Neleus it was taken to Asia Minor,
where it was hidden in a cellar to
avoid the rapacity of the agents of
the Attalid dynasty, who were seizing
all available books for the Royal
Library at Pergamon. And hereby
hangs the curious old story of the loss
of Aristotle’s works for one hundred
and fifty years, until they were rediscovered,
worm eaten, in the cellar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
Neleus at Scepsis. A Museum,—temple
of the muses,—had been built
by Theophrastus as the home of the
Lyceum. In his will he provided
that this should be maintained and
beautified, that statues of the illustrious
dead (particularly of Aristotle)
should be completed, for which commissions
had already been given to
the renowned sculptor Praxiteles;
further, that tablets with maps of the
world engraved on them should be
erected in the lower colonnade. In
acknowledgment of the claims of religion,
he also directed that an altar
should be placed there. He devised
the garden, promenade, and houses
adjoining the garden to the joint control
of Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato,
and their successors, as a trust, enjoining
that a school of philosophy
should be maintained in them, and
that the property should never be
alienated from this purpose nor
claimed as private possession. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
piously making provision for certain
friends and the support of faithful
attendants, he further directed that
he should be buried in the school
garden without unnecessary expense
or ceremony.</p>

<p>Theophrastus is more generally
known for his character sketches than
for his scientific work, although
his treatises on botany
represented the highest
attainments made by science in that
field during antiquity and the Middle
Ages. The treatise here translated
(ἠθικοὶ χαρακτῆρες) sets forth thirty
types of character striking to the
Greek mind. They are
probably a fragment or extract
made by some epitomator
from a larger treatise
which was suggested by the abstract
ethical analyses of Aristotle, as
exhibited in the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>,
and by the concrete dramatic representations
of the New Comedy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
stage suggests the form, and Aristotle’s
treatise the content. They
represent moral and social defects
and weaknesses, though not revolting
vices, but they do this in a
mimetic way by exhibiting
persons as acting or speaking.
Theophrastus was a contemporary
of Philemon and
Menander, and his life was
spent in the era of the revival of comedy
and the elaboration of current
moral types for humorous presentation
on the stage. So the characters of
Theophrastus are, as it were, <i>dramatis
personae</i> of his time. He shows us
how a given type of man speaks and
acts; the dramatization of his characters
would require scarcely anything
more than stage setting. His portrayal
is not satire, but imitation; not
caricature, but realistic delineation
from life. Moreover,
this description of generic types rather
than of individuals belongs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
literary fashion of his age. Looked
at from this mimetic point of view,
<i>The Characters</i> of Theophrastus are
historically all the more important,
because our knowledge of Menander,
the “tenth muse,” is so meagre, resting,
as it does, upon scanty Greek
fragments and a few Latin adaptations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greek
Notion of
Vice</i></div>

<p>These thirty sketches at the beginning
of the post-classical age
do not represent, properly
speaking, vices, and yet they
were vices to the mind of the
Greek, who measured his morality
largely by the canons of good form.
Any violation of good taste or breach
of courtesy was morally vicious.
The disposition was to maintain in
close unity the natures of beauty and
goodness (καλοκἀγαθία); moderns
discriminate sharply between the æsthetic
and the moral. The social
virtues of gentle breeding and the
graces of politeness toward their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
fellow men had for the classical
Greeks an ethical nature, as is witnessed
in Aristotle’s <i>Ethics</i>. Manners
and morals were not sundered.
What we call a social weakness, or defect,
or boorish crudity, Theophrastus
called a vice. It is necessary to bear
this in mind when one reads the
“<i>moral</i> characters,”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as they are called
in the Greek title.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Virtues
not Delineated</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Subject-matter
of the
Sketches</i></div>

<p>Amongst these characters there are
no virtues, and one may ask: Why
is it that in his portrayal of
types Theophrastus has altogether
omitted any description
of good men? The answer is
not to be found in the supposition
that such characters were originally
included in the work, but have since
perished. The real ground for the
omission is probably to be discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
in the nature of the conditions under
which Theophrastus wrote. These,
as we have already indicated, were
closely connected with the development
of the New Comedy. The
portrayal of a good character may be
edifying, and may serve the conditions
of tragedy, but it does not suit the
purposes or surroundings of the
comic stage, where the ludicrous
elements of weak, eccentric, or faulty
personalities are the materials employed.
The aim of Theophrastus
is both to amuse and to instruct, but
his instruction is given by exposing
to ridicule certain faults which he
elevates into the striking tangibility
of concrete character. The serious
dignity and excellence of the
good man, while it may suit
the heroic conditions of the
epic, the grave purpose of
tragedy, or the aims of moral allegory,
offers no material for such sketches
as these. Theophrastus has no concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
either with the grossly immoral
or with the helplessly weak; the
former awaken only disgust and hate,
while the latter stir only feelings of
pity, and neither of these emotions
can be kept active in the true art of
comedy. Rightly speaking, the art
of Theophrastus has to do only with
folly or with such eccentricities and
weaknesses as have a humorous
aspect. And it is only moral imperfections
of this sort that we
actually find in <i>The Characters</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ridicule as
an Instrument
of Instruction</i></div>

<p>As to the serious function of instruction
which Theophrastus no doubt
aims to combine with that
of entertainment, there is no
more skilful mode of inducing
moral betterment than
the discovery and exposure of the
ludicrous. Most men would rather
incur the charge of immorality than
be exposed to the belittling laugh or
derision of a community; they would
rather be rogues than fools. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
portrait-painter of moral life makes use
of the ludicrous when he desires to
catch the popular attention, and there
is nothing, one may safely say, that
makes society at large prick up its
ears and fall to gossiping so much as
a satire in which some well-known
person is subjected to ridicule.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Moral
Folly</i></div>

<p>Moral folly is much the same everywhere;
it is only the fool’s costume
that changes in different
countries. The folly of the
miser is seen in his cheating
himself of the real goods of life and in
robbing himself of the respect of his
fellows; the folly of the coward, in
gaining personal safety by losing reputation
for manliness; the folly of
the flatterer, in his shallow self-serving
which men see through, while they
nudge their fellows and laugh at his
weakness; the folly of the vain man,
in the way in which he assumes impressive
proportions to his own magnifying
eye, while to others his personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
looks as small as it is; the folly
of the tactless man, in consulting his
own convenience rather than his
neighbor’s, whereby he becomes a
butt for his <i>gaucherie</i>; the folly of
the boor, in his trampling awkwardly
on the established usages of the polite
world and thereby drawing upon himself
the smilingly derisive attention
of all observers. Throughout the
list these characters represent some
type of social foible or folly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Literary
Art of
Theophrastus</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Canons of
his Art</i></div>

<p>In regard to the literary art of Theophrastus,
as exhibited in these
sketches, it must be looked
at from the standpoint of an
innovation in Greek letters;
it is rare that any man both
begins and perfects an art. There
is nothing in the world so interesting
as a character, but there is also
nothing that is so difficult to portray
briefly. Theophrastus was an acute
observer and he was a plain realist.
His art consists in the truthfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
of his vision and in the direct simplicity
with which he gives it expression.
He does not seek to create
a laugh by exaggeration or by the
trick of a ludicrous situation that has
no moral significance. His art is
not possible without wit, keenness,
and fineness of feeling. There is no
exhibition of the satirist’s lash, but
his criticism is made with that geniality
which is more telling than the
severest invective. These are not
individual portraits. They lack,
therefore, the detailed finish of such
a portrait as is given in the much-elaborated
modern novel with its
varied facilities for exhibiting the individuality
of one or several persons.
On the contrary, these are merely
outline sketches, as Theophrastus
himself calls them, and are descriptive
of a class, not of an individual.
A simple line, however, does not
constitute a sketch; to exhibit a
character, the sketch must not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
be clear but complete. The coward,
<i>e.g.</i>, is sketched in his fear at sea,
where his timid imagination invents
dangers, and he wishes to be put
ashore; he is sketched on the field
of battle, where he tries to impress
his comrades by a courage that he
does not feel; but when he hears the
shouts of war and sees the soldiers
fall, he shrinks faint-hearted to his
tent and there searches for the sword
he has himself hid; and again when
the danger is over he resumes his
bold exterior and proclaims his daring
rescue of a comrade. We have here
a pictorial sketch which, with its life
and action, appeals to the reader’s
eye. The coward is shown from
various points of view, always in new
lights, but he is always the coward.
The canons of this species of literary
art may be summarized as
follows: 1.—<i>Faithfulness to
reality</i>: The character must
be an accurate report of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
and not a caricature. It must be
executed in the spirit of realism.
2.—<i>Brevity</i>: It must be slight and
swift, essentially of the nature of a
sketch. 3.—<i>Humor</i>: It must have
the sprightliness of statement that
amuses while it instructs. 4.—<i>Type</i>:
It must be illustrative of a generic
or typical fault. In other words,
the character must give embodiment
to some fault that touches human
nature in an essential and universal
way. 5.—<i>Concreteness</i>: The fault as
an abstraction must be translated by
the artist’s power into a concrete personal
form. The foible must be
revealed in a genre picture of a living
personality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Imitators
of Theophrastus</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>La Bruyère</i></div>

<p>Since Theophrastus, this form of
character-writing has been cultivated
at various times, but it flourished
most amongst the
minor essayists of the seventeenth
century. It is of too slight a
nature in itself to make a serious impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
on any literary epoch. It
suited, however, the temper of the
seventeenth century, as the sprightly
essay possessing no serious depth and
aiming to touch life at many points.
The chief imitators of Theophrastus
and exponents of character-writing
at this time were Bishop Hall, Bishop
Earle, Sir Thomas Overbury,
Nicholas Breton, Samuel Butler, and
La Bruyère. Bishop Hall, contrary
to the example of Theophrastus, includes
virtues as well as vices in his
book entitled <i>Characters of Vertues
and Vices</i> (London, 1608). In the
general structure of his composition
he follows the model of Theophrastus
closely. In the description of
vices, however, he is much more
entertaining than in his sketches of
virtues, which are rather homilies
and, as the panegyrics of a tedious
preacher, provoke one to yawn. Virtue
is not fitting material for this
species of writing. The brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
but ill-starred Sir Thomas Overbury,
in his <i>Characters or Witty Descriptions
of the Properties of Sundry Persons</i>
(London, 1614; went through
eighteen editions), departs from
the usage of Theophrastus in depicting
for the most part amusing accidents
of character and humorous
peculiarities of trades and professions.
Bishop Earle, on the other
hand, in his <i>Micro-cosmographie</i>
(London, 1628) confined his character
delineation to <i>mores hominum</i>, to ethical
types of men as such, in a spirit
similar to that of his Greek model.
The best known of all the imitators
of Theophrastus, if he can be called
an imitator at all, is La Bruyère,
in his <i>Les caractères ou
les mœurs de ce siècle</i> (Paris, 1688).
The <i>caractères</i> of La Bruyère are
really satires on certain thinly disguised
contemporaries of his own
and are executed in a spirited method
totally different from that of Theophrastus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
but to which a translation
of <i>The Characters</i> of Theophrastus
is added. La Bruyère was a lover
of the ancient classics, although his
translation or paraphrase was hardly
more than a pretext for writing down
his own description of the manners
of his time. It furnished him, perhaps,
the first suggestion and the
first impulse to the portrayal of the
vices and weaknesses of his contemporaries
on a much larger scale than
Theophrastus had attempted.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Theophrastus to Polycles</span>:</p>

<p class="dropcap">Many a time ere now I have
stopped to think and wonder,—I
fancy the marvel
will never grow less,—why it is
that we Greeks are not all one
in character, for we have the same
climate throughout the country,
and our people enjoy the same
education. I have studied human
nature a long time, my dear Polycles,
for I have lived nine and
ninety years;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I have conversed
with many men of divers characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and have been at great
pains to observe both good and
bad. I have fancied, therefore,
I ought to set down in writing
how men live and act. I shall
describe their characters, each after
its kind, and show you their besetting
weaknesses. I dare say,
Polycles, our children will be the
better, if we leave them memorials
of this sort; and as they
study these patterns of good<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
ill, they will elect, I think, to live
and hold communion with men
of the highest type. In this
way they will strive to maintain
the level of the highest. I turn
now to my task. Yours it is to
follow me and see if what I say
is true. I begin my book with
a description of the <i>Dissembler</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
omitting any preface and details
about the word. And first of
all I shall lay down a definition
of dissembling, and with this in
view shall describe the dissembler
in his character and manner of
life, exhibiting in such clearness,
as I can, his various traits.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This dedication is now thought to be spurious.

<h2 id="Chapter_1">I <i>The Dissembler</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Εἰρωνεία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Dissembling, generally
speaking, is an affectation,
whether in word or action,
intended to make things seem
other than they really are. The
dissembler is a man, for instance,
who accosts his enemies and engages
readily in talk with them,
to show that he bears no grudge,
and who praises to their faces
the very men he slanders behind
their backs; and when these lose
a suit at court, he professes sympathy
for their misfortune. When
men malign him, or the opposition’s
loud, he is ever ready with
forgiveness.</p>

<p>When others have suffered such ill-treatment
as to have just cause
for indignation, his comments on
their wrongs are couched in non-committal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
terms. And when a
man is anxious to have an interview
with him, he bids him come
again, pretending that he has
just reached home, that the hour
is late, or that his health is too
feeble to bear the strain.</p>

<p>He never admits anything he is
doing, but at most will say that
he is considering it. When a
friend would borrow of him, or
would solicit his contribution, he
says “Business is dreadfully dull”;
though at other times, when
business is really dull, he reports
a thriving trade. If he has
received a bit of news, he will
not admit he has heard it; and
when he has witnessed an occurrence,
he will not admit he
has seen it; or if he does admit
it, he protests he can’t recall
it. And of one matter, he
says he will examine it; of another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that he doesn’t know; of
others, that he is amazed; of yet
others, that he had thought of that
himself before. In short, he is a
master of phrases like these: “I
can’t believe it”; “I fail to comprehend”;
“I’m dumfounded”;
“By your account the fellow has
become a different man”; “He
certainly didn’t tell <i>me</i> that”;
“The thing’s improbable”; “Tell
that to the marines!”; “I’m at a
loss how I can either doubt your
story or condemn my friend”;
“But see whether you’re not too
credulous.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_2">II <i>The Flatterer</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Κολακεία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Flattery is a cringing sort
of conduct that aims to promote
the advantage of the
flatterer. The flatterer is the
kind of man who, as he walks
with an acquaintance, says: “Behold!
how the people gaze at
you! There is not a man in
the city who enjoys so much notice
as yourself. Yesterday your
praises were the talk of the Porch.
While above thirty men were sitting
there together and the conversation
fell upon the topic:
‘Who is our noblest citizen?’
they all began and ended with
your name.” As the flatterer
goes on talking in this strain he
picks a speck of lint from his
hero’s cloak; or if the wind has
lodged a bit of straw in his locks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
he plucks it off and says laughingly,
“See you? Because I
have not been with you these
two days, your beard is turned
gray. And yet if any man has
a beard that is black for his years,
it is you.”</p>

<p>While his patron speaks, he bids
the rest be silent. He sounds
his praises in his hearing and
after the patron’s speech gives
the cue for applause by “Bravo!”
If the patron makes a stale jest,
the flatterer laughs and stuffs his
sleeve into his mouth as though
he could not contain himself.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>If they meet people on the street,
he asks them to wait until master
passes. He buys apples and
pears, carries them to his hero’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
house and gives them to the
children, and in the presence of
the father, who is looking on, he
kisses them, exclaiming: “Bairns
of a worthy sire!” When the
patron buys a pair of shoes, the
flatterer observes: “The foot is
of a finer pattern than the boot”;
if he calls on a friend, the flatterer
trips on ahead and says: “<i>You</i>
are to have the honor of his visit”;
and then turns back with, “I have
announced you.” Of course he
can run and do the errands at the
market in a twinkle.</p>

<p>Amongst guests at a banquet he is
the first to praise the wine and,
doing it ample justice, he observes:
“What a fine cuisine you
have!” He takes a bit from
the board and exclaims: “What
a dainty morsel this is!” Then
he inquires whether his friend is
chilly, asks if he would like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
wrap put over his shoulders, and
whether he shall throw one about
him. With these words he bends
over and whispers in his ear.
While his talk is directed to the
rest, his eye is fixed on his patron.
In the theatre he takes the cushions
from the page and himself
adjusts them for the comfort of
the master. Of his hero’s house
he says: “It is well built”; of
his farm: “It is well tilled”; and
of his portrait: “It is a speaking
image.”</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_3">III <i>The Coward</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Δειλία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Cowardice is a certain
shrinking of the heart. A
coward is a man who, as he
sails along, imagines that the cliffs
in the distance are pirate ships;
if the waves are high, he asks if
there’s anybody in the ship’s
company who has not been initiated
into the mysteries.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He bends
over toward the helmsman and
inquires whether he intends to
keep to the high sea, and what
he thinks of the weather; and to
his companion says that he is in
terror in consequence of a dream
he has had; and he takes off his
tunic and gives it to his slave,
and begs to be set on shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>In a campaign, when the infantry
march forth, he bids his comrades
stand by him and look sharp,
urging the importance of finding
out whether yonder object be the
foe or not. When he hears the
sound of battle, and sees men
fall, he says to those about him
that, in his haste, he has forgotten
to take his sword; then he runs
back to his tent, sends his servant
out and bids him see where the
enemy are; meanwhile he hides
his weapon<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> under his pillow,
and then wastes a long time hunting
for it. While in his tent,
seeing one of his companions
brought wounded from the field,
he runs out, bids the fellow
“Cheer up!” and lends a hand
to carry the stretcher. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he stays to tend the sufferer,
washes his wounds, and sits by
his side driving away the flies,—anything
but fight the enemy.</p>

<p>When the trumpeter sounds the
signal for a fresh onset, he exclaims
as he sits in his tent:
“Plague take him! He won’t let
the poor fellow get to sleep with
his eternal bugling.” Then, staining
himself with blood from the
other’s wound, he meets the
troops as they return from battle,
and pretending to have been in
the thick of the fight, he exclaims,
“I’ve saved a comrade!”
And then he takes his demesmen
and tribesmen into the tent, and
assures each one of them that he
himself brought the wounded
man to the tent with his own
hands.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_4">IV <i>The Over-zealous Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Περιεργία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Over-zealousness is
an excess in saying or doing,—with
good intentions,
of course. The over-zealous man
is one who gets up in public and
engages to do things which he cannot
perform. In cases where no
doubt exists in the mind of anyone
else, he raises some objection—only
to be refuted.</p>

<p>At a banquet, he forces the servants
to mix more wine than the
guests can drink. If he sees two
men in a quarrel, he strives to
part them though he knows
neither one. Leaving the main
road he leads his friends upon
a by-path and presently cannot
find his way. He accosts his
commander and inquires when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is going to draw up the troops
for battle, and what orders he
intends to issue for day after
to-morrow.</p>

<p>He goes and tells his father that
his mother is already asleep in
her chamber. If the doctor gives
instructions that no wine be given
a patient, he administers “just a
little,” on the plea that he wants
to set the sufferer right. And
when a woman dies, he has
carved on the tombstone her
husband’s name, and her father’s
and her mother’s, along with the
woman’s own name and her
native place, and adds: “Worthy
people, all of them.” In court,
as he takes the oath, he remarks
to the bystanders, “I have done
this many a time before.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_5">V <i>The Tactless Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀκαιρία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Tactlessness is the faculty
of hitting a moment
that is unpleasant to the
persons concerned. The tactless
man is the sort of person who
selects a man’s busy hour to go
and confer with him. He serenades
his sweetheart when she has
a fever. If an acquaintance has
just lost bail-money on a friend,
he hunts him up and asks him
to be his surety. After a verdict
has been rendered he appears at
the trial to give evidence. At a
wedding where he is a guest
he declaims against womankind.</p>

<p>When a friend has just finished a
long journey he invites him to
go for a walk. He has a faculty
for fetching a higher bidder for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
an article after it has been sold;
and in a group of companions he
gets up and explains from the beginning
a story which the others
have just heard and have completely
understood. He is anxious
to give himself the trouble to
do what nobody wants done, and
yet what nobody likes to decline.</p>

<p>When men are in the midst of
religious offerings and are making
outlay of money, he goes to
collect his interest. If he happens
to be standing by when a
slave is flogged, he tells the
story of how he once flogged a
slave, who then went away and
hanged himself. If he is arbitrator
in a dispute, he sets both contestants
by the ears just at the
moment when they are ready to
settle their differences. When
he wants to dance he takes a
partner who is not yet merry.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_6">VI <i>The Shameless Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀναισχυντία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Shamelessness may be
defined as contempt for decency,
joined with meanness
of purpose. Your shameless
fellow is one who robs a man and
then returns to borrow money of
him. He sacrifices a victim to
the gods, and instead of making
his supper from it, he salts the
meat down and then gets a meal
at the house of a friend. He
calls a servant, and, taking bread
and meat from the table, says in
a voice that all can hear: “Try
that, Tibios!”</p>

<p>When he goes to market, he reminds
the butcher of all the
patronage he has given him,
and as he stands by the scales,
throws in an extra piece, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
can, or if not, a soup-bone. If
he secures these, he rests content.
If he fails, he snatches
a piece of tripe from the bench
and makes off with it laughing.
He buys theatre tickets
for friends that are staying in
town and goes along with them
to the performance, but does
not contribute his share of the
expense; and the next day you’ll
find him taking his children and
their tutor, too.</p>

<p>When anybody has found a bargain
in any line, he demands to have
a share. He goes to the neighbors
and borrows barley, or sometimes
even bran, and actually
endeavors to make those who
lend him these articles deliver
them at his house. A favorite
trick of his is to march up to the
tubs in a private bath-house,
draw a bucket of warm water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dash it over his head, despite the
loud protests of the attendant,
and then say, as he leaves:
“That’s a good bath; no thanks
to you!”</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_7">VII <i>The Newsmonger</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Λογοπολιία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Newsmaking is the concoction
of false stories of
what people say and do, at
the gossip’s caprice. The newsmonger
is one who straightway
strikes an attitude and assumes
a smiling air when he meets a
friend, and asks: “Where have
you been? What news? How
is the situation? Have you any
fresh word about it?” and then
going straight on, he asks: “Is
there no later report? Well! the
current rumors are good.”</p>

<p>And without letting his friend reply,
he keeps right on: “What! you
haven’t heard a word about it!
Then I think I have a feast of
news for you.” He always has
in readiness some unheard-of soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or a slave belonging to one
Asteus, a piper, or Lycon, an
obscure contractor, just back from
the battle-field; and it is from
one of these that he has heard
the tidings. The authorities for
his reports are of the sort that
you can never get hold of. Such
are the men he quotes when he
tells how Polyperchon and the
king carried the day and Cassander
was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>If anybody asks: “Do <i>you</i> believe
this?” he replies, “Why the
story is noised all about the city,
is constantly gaining ground, and
the whole population is of one
mind; everybody is agreed about
the battle; it must have been
a regular Death’s feast.” He
reads a proof of it too in the
faces of men in authority; for
they all wear a changed look.
He says he overheard that a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had come from Macedonia who
knows the whole history of the
battle, and that he has been concealed
now five days in a house
with the authorities. There is a
convincing pathos in his voice—you
can imagine it!—as he tells
his story and exclaims: “Luckless
Cassander!<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> ill-starred hero!
Lo! the fickleness of fortune!
Vain it was that he rose to power.
But what I say is strictly between
ourselves.” Then he trips off
and repeats the story to every
man in town.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_8">VIII <i>The Mean Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Μικρολογία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Meanness is undue sparing
of expense. The mean
man is the sort of person
who will go to a creditor’s house
and demand a half-penny interest
before the month is up. At
dinner he counts the glasses each
guest drinks, and amongst his
fellow banqueters he pours the
smallest offering to Artemis.</p>

<p>He counts up the price a friend pays
for a cheap purchase, exclaiming
that it takes his last penny. If a
servant breaks a pot or plate he
deducts its value from his rations.
If his wife has lost a three-farthing
piece, he turns the furniture,
beds, and cupboards round and
round, and hunts between the
boards of the floor. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
has anything to sell he puts the
price so high that the buyer gets
no bargain. He permits no one
to take a fig from his garden or
to cross his field, or even pick up
an olive or a date that has fallen
to the ground. He examines
his boundary marks every day
to see that they have not been
touched.</p>

<p>And he is always ready in case of
default to use the right of seizure
and to collect compound interest.
When he gives a banquet to his
townsmen he cuts the meat in
small pieces and sets a portion
before each guest. He goes to
market, but buys nothing. He
forbids his wife to lend salt or a
lamp-wick or a pinch of cummin,
marjoram, or meal, a fillet
or a sacrificial wafer, observing
that these trifles make a large
sum in the course of a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In a word, one may see that the
mean man’s money chest is
mouldy from being unopened,
the key rusty, his cloak too scant
to reach his thigh; that he uses
a mean little oil jar, has his hair
cropped to the scalp; he does
not wear his boots until midday,
and charges the fuller to use
plenty of earth on his coat to
keep it from soon getting soiled
again.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_9">IX <i>The Stupid Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀναισθησία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Stupidity one may define
as sluggishness in what a man
says or does. The stupid
man computes a sum, sets down
the total, and then asks his neighbor:
“How much does it all
make?” When he is defendant
in a suit and should go to court,
he forgets all about it and puts
off to his farm. When he goes
to a play at the theatre he is the
only spectator that is left behind
on the benches asleep. He gets
up in the night to go out, after
he has gorged himself, and is
bitten by the neighbor’s dog.
He takes a thing and puts it away,
but when he comes to look for it
he cannot find it. If the death
of a friend is announced to him
that he may go to the funeral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with a sorrowful air and tears in
his eyes he says: “Thank God!”
When he goes to receive payment
of a debt, he takes witnesses
with him. In the winter season
he quarrels with his slave because
cucumbers have not been provided.
He forces his children to wrestle
and to run until they fall into
a fever. When he is roughing it
in the country and himself cooks
the vegetables, he puts salt in the
pot twice and so makes the dish
impossible. When it rains and
others declare that the sky is
darker than pitch, he exclaims:
“How sweet it is to consider the
stars!” And if he is asked, what
is the mortality of the city,—how
many bodies have passed
through the Sacred Gates,—he

<h2 id="Chapter_10">X <i>The Surly Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Αὐθάδεια)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Surliness is sullen rudeness
of speech. The surly man
is one who, when you ask
him, “Who is that gentleman?”
retorts “Don’t bother me!” and
when you greet him on the street
refuses to return your salutation.
When he has anything for sale,
he will not tell the purchaser
what he charges, but instead inquires,
“How much do I get for
it?” When one would show him
some attention and sends him a
gift for the holidays, he says he
is not in need of presents.</p>

<p>He accepts no excuse when by accident
you smutch his clothes, or
push against him in a crowd, or
chance to tread upon his foot.
If you ask for his contribution to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
some object, he refuses to make
one, though afterwards he may
bring it around, declaring, however,
that he’s throwing the
money away. Sometimes he
stumbles in the street, and then
he curses the stone that tripped
him up.</p>

<p>And he’s not a man to tarry many
minutes for a friend who has
an appointment with him. Singing,
declamation, and dancing are
amusements for which he has no
taste; and it’s exactly like him
to refuse to join even in prayer
to the gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_11">XI <i>The Superstitious Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Δεισιδαιμονία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Superstition is a crouching
fear of unseen powers.
The superstitious man is the
sort of person who begins the
day only after he has sprinkled
himself, washed his hands with
holy water, and taken a sprig of
laurel in his mouth. If a weasel
cross his path, he will not go
a step further until some one
else has crossed, or until he has
thrown three stones over the way.
If he sees a snake in his house,
he prays to Sabazius<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (provided
it is a copperhead) or, if it be
a sacred serpent, he straightway
builds a shrine upon the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>As he passes by the consecrated
stones at the cross-roads, he pours
oil on them from his flask, falls
on his knees, and prays before he
goes further. If a mouse should
gnaw through a leather flour-bag,
he goes to the seer and asks what
he shall do. If the seer bids him
give the bag to the cobbler to be
sewn up, he pays no heed to
him, but goes his way and offers
up the bag as a holy sacrifice.</p>

<p>He is given to purifying his house
often by religious rites and insists
it is haunted by Hecate. When
he takes a walk and hears an owl
hoot, he is terrified and cries out:
“Athena! thine is the power!”
and so walks on. He will not
step on a grave, nor go up to a
corpse, nor to a woman in confinement,
but says it is not well
to risk pollution. He orders
his domestics to mull the wine on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the fourth and seventh of the
month, while he goes out and
buys myrtle, incense, and holy
cakes; on his return he spends
the livelong day in crowning the
images of Hermaphroditus.</p>

<p>When he has had a vision, he goes
to the soothsayer, the seer, or the
augur, to ask to what god or
goddess he must pray. He goes
to the Orphic mysteries to be
initiated into them. You will be
sure to find him amongst the
people who frequent the beach to
besprinkle themselves. Every
month he goes there with his
wife, or if his wife is busy, then
with the nurse and children.</p>

<p>If he observes any one at the cross-roads
crowned with garlic, on his
return he washes himself from
head to foot, summons a priestess,
and gives orders to celebrate rites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of purification either with an
onion or a small dog. Whenever
he sees a madman or an
epileptic, he shakes with terror
and spits in his bosom.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_12">XII <i>The Thankless Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Μεμψιμοιρία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Thanklessness is an
improper criticism of what
one receives. The thankless
man, when a friend has sent him
something from his table, says to
the servant who brings it, “He
grudged me a dish of soup and a
cup of wine, I suppose, and so
wouldn’t invite me to dinner.”
When his sweetheart kisses him,
he says, “I wonder if you really
do love me so in your heart.”</p>

<p>He blames Zeus, not for raining,
but for not raining before. When
he picks up a purse in the street,
he says, “But I never found a
treasure!” If he secures a slave
at a bargain after long dickering
with the owner, he says, “I imagine
I haven’t got much at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
price.” To the person who brings
the glad tidings that a son is born
to him, he retorts, “If you only
add, ‘And half your fortune’s
gone,’ you’ll hit it.”</p>

<p>When he wins his case in court and
secures a unanimous verdict, he
abuses his attorney for having
omitted many points in his brief.
When his friends make him up a
purse, and wish him joy, “Why
so?” he exclaims. “Is it because
I shall have to pay you all back
and be grateful into the bargain,
as though you had done me a
favor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_13">XIII <i>The Suspicious Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀπιστία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Suspicion is a kind of belief
that everybody is fraudulent.
The suspicious man is the sort
of person who sends a servant to
market and then sends another
to watch him and find out the
price he pays. When he carries
the money himself, he sits down
every hundred yards and counts
it over. After he is in bed he
asks his wife whether she locked
the chest and shut the cupboard,
and whether the hall-door bolt
was pushed well in. If she answers
“Yes!” he gets up, nevertheless,
and lights a lamp; naked
and barefoot he goes around
and examines everything. Even
then he finds it hard to go to
sleep. When he goes to collect
interest, he takes witnesses along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lest his debtors deny the claims.
He has his cloak dyed, not by the
best workman, but by the fuller
who can furnish good security.
If any one asks the loan of a
wine-set, he prefers not to lend it;
but if a member of his family or
a near relative wants it, he makes
the loan; yet he scarcely does
so until he has had it assayed and
weighed and has received a guarantee
for its safe return. He
orders his footman not to fall
behind him, but to go in front so
that by watching him he may prevent
his running away. If a purchaser
has bought goods of him
and says: “Charge the amount
to me; I have no time now to
send the money,” he replies:
“Do not trouble yourself about
it; when you have finished your
business, I will go with you and
get my pay.”</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_14">XIV <i>The Disagreeable
Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀηδία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Disagreeableness we
may define as a kind of
conduct which is annoying,
although it may not be injurious.
The disagreeable man will go to a
friend and wake him out of a
sound sleep to have a talk with
him. He detains passengers who
are on the point of embarking;
others who have come to see him
he bids wait until he has taken
his walk. He takes the baby
from its nurse, chews its food for
it and feeds it, dandles it on his
knee while he cooes to it and calls
it “Papa’s little rascal!”</p>

<p>At table he tells the company how
he once took hellebore and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
physicked through and through,
and how his bile was blacker
than the soup on the table. And
he asks before the family: “I
say, mammy, what day was it
when you were confined and I
was born?” He says he has
cool cistern water at his house
and a garden full of tender vegetables;
that his cook is a perfect
<i>chef</i>, and that his house is a regular
hotel, for it is always full of company,
and his guests are like leaky
sieves,—do the best he can, it is
impossible to fill them.</p>

<p>When he gives a dinner he exhibits
his jester and shows him off before
the company. To enliven
his guests over their cups, he says
that further pleasures have been
arranged for them.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_15">XV <i>The Exquisite</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Μικροφιλοτιμία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Exquisiteness is a striving
for honor in small things.
The exquisite when invited
to dinner, is eager to sit by his
host. When he cuts off his son’s
hair for an offering to the gods,
no place but Delphi will answer
for the ceremony. His attendant
must be an Ethiopian.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> When
he pays a mina<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of money he
makes a point of offering a freshly
minted piece. If he has a pet
daw in the house, he must needs
buy it a ladder and a brazen
shield, that the daw may learn to
climb the ladder carrying the
shield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>When he has sacrificed an ox, he
winds the head and horns with
fillets, and nails them up opposite
the entrance, in order that those
who come in may see what he
has been doing. When he parades
with the cavalry, he gives
all his accoutrements to his squire
to carry home, and throwing back
his mantle stalks proudly about
the market-place in his spurs.
When his pet dog dies, he raises
a monument to the creature, and
has a pillar erected with the inscription:
“Fido, Pure Maltese.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
In the Asclepieion<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> he
dedicates a brazen finger,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> polishes
it, crowns it with flowers,
and anoints it every day with
oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>And he has his hair cut frequently.
His teeth are always pearly white.
While his old suit is still good, he
gets himself a new one; and he
anoints himself with the choicest
perfumes.</p>

<p>In the agora he frequents the banker’s
counters. If he visits the gymnasia,
he selects those in which
the ephebi<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> practise; and, when
there’s a play, the place he
chooses in the theatre is close
beside the generals.</p>

<p>He makes few purchases for himself,
but sends presents to his friends
at Byzantium, and Spartan dogs
to Cyzicus, and Hymettian honey
to Rhodes; and when he does
these things, he tells it about the
town. Naturally, his taste runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to pet monkeys, parrots, Sicilian
doves, gazelles’ knuckle-bones,
Thurian jars, crooked canes from
Sparta, hangings inwrought with
Persian figures, a wrestling-ring
sprinkled with sand, and a tennis-court.
He goes around and offers
this arena to philosophers, sophists,
fighters, and musicians, for
their exhibitions; and at the performances
he himself comes in
last of all, that the spectators
may say to one another, “That’s
the gentleman to whom the place
belongs.”</p>

<p>And, of course, when he is a prytanis<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
he demands of his colleagues the
privilege of announcing to the
people the result of the sacrifice;
then putting on a fine garment
and a garland of flowers, he advances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and says: “O men of
Athens, we prytanes have made
sacrifice to the mother of the
gods;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the sacrifice is fair and
good. Receive ye each your portion.”
When he has made this
announcement, he returns home
and tells his wife all about it in
an ecstasy of joy.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_17">XVII <i>The Bore</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Δαλία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">We may define a bore as a
man who cannot refrain
from talking. A bore is
the sort of fellow who, the moment
you open your mouth, tells
you that your remarks are idle,
that he knows all about it, and if
you’ll only listen, you’ll soon
find it out. As you attempt to
make answer, he suddenly breaks
in with such interruptions as:
“Don’t forget what you were
about to say”—“That reminds
me”—“What an admirable thing
talk is!”—“But, as I omitted to
mention”—“You grasp the idea
at once”—“I was watching this
long time to see whether you
would come to the same conclusion
as myself.” In phrases like
this he’s so fertile that the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
who happens to meet him cannot
even open his mouth to speak.</p>

<p>When he has vanquished a few stray
victims here and there, his next
move is to advance upon whole
companies and put them to flight
in the midst of their occupations.
He goes upon the wrestling
ground or into the schools, and
prevents the boys from making
progress with their lessons, so
incessant is his talk with the
teachers and the wrestling-masters.</p>

<p>If you say you are going home, he’s
pretty sure to come along and
escort you to your house.</p>

<p>Whenever he learns the day set for
the session of the Assembly he
noises it diligently abroad, and
recalls Demosthenes’s famous bout
with Aeschines in the archonship
of Aristophon. He mentions,
too, his own humble effort on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
certain occasion, and the approval
which it won among the people.
As he rattles on he launches invectives
against the masses, in
such fashion that his audience
either becomes oblivious or begins
to doze, or else melts away in the
midst of his harangue.</p>

<p>When he’s on a jury he’s an obstacle
to reaching a verdict, when
he’s in the theatre he prevents
attention to the play; at a feast
he hinders eating, remarking that
silence is too much of an effort,
that his tongue is hung in the
middle, and that he couldn’t
keep still, even though he should
seem a worse chatterer than a
magpie; and when he’s made a
butt by his own children, he submits,—when
in their desire to
go to sleep they say, “Papa, tell
us something, in order that sleep
may come.”</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_18">XVIII <i>The Rough</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀπόνοια)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Roughness is coarse conduct,
whether in word or act.
The rough takes an oath
lightly and is insensible to insult
and ready to give it. In character
he is a sort of town bully,
obscene in manner, ready for anything
and everything. He is
willing, sober and without a mask,
to dance the vulgar cordax<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in
comic chorus. At a show he goes
around from man to man and
collects the pennies, quarrelling
with the spectators who present
a pass and therefore insist on
seeing the performance free.</p>

<p>He is the sort of man to keep a
hostelry,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or brothel, or to farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the taxes. There is no business
he considers beneath him, but he
is ready to follow the trade of
crier, cook, or gambler. He does
not support his mother, is caught
at theft and spends more time
in jail than in his home. He is
the type of man who collects a
crowd of bystanders and harangues
them in a loud brawling
voice; while he is talking, some
are going and others coming, without
listening to him; to one part
of the moving crowd he tells the
beginning of his story, to another
part a sketch of it, and to another
part a mere fragment. He regards
a holiday as the fittest time for the
full exhibition of his roughness.</p>

<p>He is a great figure in the courts
as plaintiff or defendant. Sometimes
he excuses himself on oath
from trial but later he appears
with a bundle of papers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
breast of his cloak, and a file of
documents in his hands. He enjoys
the rôle of generalissimo in
a band of rowdy loafers; he lends
his followers money and on every
shilling collects a penny interest
per day. He visits the bake-shops,
the markets for fresh and
pickled fish, collects his tribute
from them, and stuffs it in his
cheek.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_19">XIX <i>The Affable Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀρέσκεια)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Affability is a sort of
demeanor that gives pleasure
at the sacrifice of what
is best. The affable man is the
kind of person who hails a friend
at a distance, and after he has
told him what a fine fellow he is,
and has lavished brimming admiration
on him, seizes both his
hands, and is unwilling to let
him go. He escorts the friend a
step on his way, and as he asks
“When shall we meet again?”
tears himself away with praises
still falling from his lips.</p>

<p>When summoned to court he wishes
to please not merely the man in
whose interest he appears, but his
adversary too, that he may seem
to be non-partisan; and of strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he says that they pronounce
juster judgment than his townsmen.
If he’s invited out to
dinner he asks his host to call in
the children, and when they come,
he declares they’re as like their
father as one fig is like another,
and he draws them toward him,
kisses them, and sets them by his
side. Sometimes he joins in their
sports, shouting “Strike!” and
“Foul!”; and sometimes he lets
them go to sleep in his lap in
spite of the burden.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_20">XX <i>The Impudent Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Βδελυρία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Impudence is easy to define;
it is conduct that is obtrusively
offensive. The impudent man
is one who, on meeting respectable
women in the street, insults
them as he passes. At a play, he
claps his hands after all the rest
have stopped, and hisses the players
when others wish to watch in
silence. When the theatre is still,
he suddenly stands up and disgorges,
to make the audience look
around. When the market-place
is crowded, he steps up to the
stalls where nuts, myrtle-berries,
or fruits are for sale, and begins to
pick at them as he talks to the
merchant; he calls by name
people whom he doesn’t know,
and stops those intent upon some
errand. When a man has just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
lost an important case and is now
leaving the court, he runs up and
tenders his congratulations.</p>

<p>He buys his own provisions,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> too, and
hires his own musicians, showing
his purchases to every man he
meets and inviting him to come
and share the feast. Again, he
takes his stand before a barber’s
booth or a perfumer’s stall, and
proclaims unblushingly his intention
of getting drunk.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_21">XXI <i>The Gross Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Δυσχέρεια)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Grossness is such neglect
of one’s person as gives offence
to others. The gross
man is one who goes about with
an eczema, or white eruption, or
diseased nails, and says that these
are congenital ailments; for his
father had them, and his grandfather,
too, and it would be hard
to foist an outsider upon their
family. He’s very apt to have
sores on his shins and bruises on
his toes, and to neglect these
things so that they grow worse.</p>

<p>His armpits are hairy like an animal’s
for a long distance down
his sides; his teeth are black and
decayed. As he eats, he blows
his nose with his fingers. As he
talks, he drools, and has no sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
drunk wine than up it comes.
After bathing he uses rancid oil
to anoint himself; and when he
goes to the market-place, he
wears a thick tunic and a thin
outer garment disfigured with
spots of dirt.</p>

<p>When his mother goes to consult
the soothsayer, he utters words
of evil omen; and when people
pray and offer sacrifices to the gods
he lets the goblet fall, laughing
as though he had done something
amusing. When there’s playing
on the flute, he alone of the company
claps his hands, singing an
accompaniment and upbraiding
the musician for stopping so soon.</p>

<p>Often he tries to spit across the
table,—only to miss the mark
and hit the butler.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_22">XXII <i>The Boor</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀγροικία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Boorishness is ignorance
of good form. The boor is
the sort of man who takes
a strong drink and then goes to
the Assembly. He insists that
myrrh has not a whit sweeter
smell than onions. His boots
are too big for his feet and he
talks in a loud voice.</p>

<p>He distrusts even friends and kinsmen,
while his most important
secrets are shared with his domestics,
and he tells all the news
of the Assembly to his farm
hands. Nothing awakens his admiration
or startles him on the
streets so much as the sight of
an ox, an ass, or a goat, and then
he stands agape in contemplation.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
He is the sort of man who
snatches a bite from the pantry
and drinks his liquor straight.</p>

<p>He has clandestine talks with the
cook and helps her grind the meal
for his household. At breakfast
he throws bits to the animals
about the table. He answers the
knock at the door himself and
then whistles for his dog, takes
him by the nose, and says:
“Here’s the keeper of my house
and grounds!” When a man
offers him a coin he declines it,
saying it is too worn, and takes
another piece in its stead.</p>

<p>After loaning a plough, basket, sickle,
or sack, he goes after it, unable
to sleep for thinking of it. When
he goes to town he inquires of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
any chance passer-by: “What
are hides selling for? What’s
the price of bacon? Does the
celebration of New Moon come
to-day?” Then he remarks he
must go down street and have
his hair cut, and while in town
must also run into the shop of
Archias and buy the bacon. He
sings in the public baths and
wears hob-nailed boots.</p>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀνελευθερία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Penuriousness is the
grudging of expense and is
due to great love of money
and little love of honor. The
penurious man, after a victory on
the tragic stage, sets up a wooden
chaplet to Dionysus, on which he
inscribes his own name. If contributions
from the public are
asked for, he is silent or rises and
quits the company. When he
gives his daughter in marriage, he
sells the sacrificial offerings, excepting
the parts that belong by
law to the priests. At the wedding,
he employs only servants
who will eat at home.</p>

<p>As trierarch<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he takes the pilot’s
blankets and spreads them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
deck for himself, while he puts
his own away. He is the sort of
man who keeps his children from
school when a festival comes, and
makes excuses for them on the
plea of ill-health, that he may
avoid the fee for tuition.</p>

<p>When he goes to market, he brings
the meat home with him, carrying
the vegetables in the folds of
his cloak. He stays indoors
when he sends his tunic to the
cleaner. If he catches sight of a
friend coming towards him and
soliciting contributions, he sneaks
off through a by-street and goes
home by a roundabout way. He
employs no maid for his wife,
although she brought him a
dowry, but hires a child from the
woman’s market to accompany
her on her errands.</p>

<p>He keeps his patched shoes until they
are twice worn out, saying they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
are still good, and tough as horn.
When he gets up, he dusts the
house and makes the beds, and
when he sits down he lays aside
the coat he is wearing in order
to spare it.</p>

<p class="subhead">(Ὑπερηφανία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Pompousness is contempt
for everybody save one’s self.
If you have urgent business,
the pompous man will tell you
that he will meet you after dinner
on his walk. If he has done you a
favor, he reminds you of it. When
elected to office he declines, saying
under oath he has no leisure.
He is not disposed to make the
first call on anybody. Tradesmen
and hired men he orders to
come to him by daybreak.</p>

<p>As he passes along the street, he does
not greet the men he meets; he
lowers his eyes and when it suits
him raises them again. If he
entertains friends he does not dine
with them, but instructs some of
his underlings to attend to the
duties of entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>He sends a messenger ahead when
he makes a call, to say that he
approaches. He allows no one
to enter while he is at his oil-rub,
his bath, or his dinner. When
he is casting an account, he instructs
a slave to set down the
items, foot up the total, and arrange
it in a statement for him.
He does not write in a letter:
“You would do me a favor,” but
“I want this done,” and “I have
sent for this and wish to have it,”
and “See to it that my orders are
followed precisely,” and “Have
this done immediately.”</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_25">XXV <i>The Braggart</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ἀλαζονεία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Bragging is pretending to
have excellences that one
does not really possess. The
braggart is the man who stands
on the wharf and tells the bystanders
how much capital he
has invested in ships at sea, and
tells how extensive is his business
of loaning money, and how
much he has made and lost by
different ventures. As he talks
thus magnificently, he sends his
slave to his banker, where he has—exactly
one shilling to his
credit. On a journey he imposes
on his travelling companion by
telling him that he once served
with Alexander, and how intimate
were their relations, and how
many jewelled cups he brought
back from his campaigns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the Asiatic artists, he
counts them better than those in
Europe. And all this he tells
you without having once set foot
outside his native city. He claims
further to have three letters from
Antipater<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> bidding him come to
Macedonia; but he declares that,
though he has been guaranteed the
privilege of exporting wood free
of duty, he has refused to go, simply
to avoid being suspected by
his fellow-citizens of foreign leanings.
The Macedonians, he says,
in urging him so to come, ought
to have considered this point.</p>

<p>In time of famine, he says, his expenditures
for the poor amounted to
over five talents; for he hadn’t the
heart to refuse. When he’s with
strangers, he often bids some one
place the reckoning counters on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the table, and computing by six
hundreds and by minae, glibly
mentioning the names of his pretended
debtors, he makes a total of
twenty-four talents, saying that the
whole sum had gone for voluntary
contributions, and that, too, without
including subscriptions for the
navy or for other public objects.</p>

<p>At times he goes to the horse-market
where blooded stock is
for sale, and makes pretence of
wanting to buy; and stepping
up to the block, he hunts
his clothes for two talents, upbraiding
his servant for coming
along without any money.
Though he lives in a rented
house, he represents it to those
who do not know as the family
homestead; yet adds that he
thinks of selling it as being too
small for the proper entertainment
of his friends.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_26">XXVI <i>The Oligarch</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Ὀλιγαρχία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Oligarchy is a love of
power that clings tightly to
personal advantage. The
oligarch rises in the people’s
councils, when assistants to the
archon are elected for the management
of a fête, and says:
“These men must have absolute
control.” And although others
have suggested ten, he insists
that <i>one</i> is enough, but he must
be a <i>man</i>. The only line of
Homer that stays in his memory
is: “A crowd’s rule is bad; let
there be one ruler.” He knows
no other verse. He is, however,
an adept at such phrases as this:
“We must hold a caucus and
make our plans; we must cut
loose from mob and market; we
must throw aside the annoyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of petty office and of insult or
honor at the masses’ whim; we
or they must rule the state.”</p>

<p>At midday he goes out with his
mantle thrown about him, his
hair dressed in the mode and his
nails fashionably trimmed; he
promenades down Odeon Way
ejaculating: “Sycophants have
made the city no longer habitable.
What outrages we endure
in court from our persecutors!
Why men nowadays go into office,
is a marvel to me. How ungrateful
the mob is! although
one is always giving, giving.”</p>

<p>If, at the Assembly, a naked,
hungry vagabond sits next to
him, he complains of the outrage.
“When,” he asks, “is a
stop to be put to this ruin of
our property by taxation for fêtes
and navy? How odious is this
crew of demagogues! Theseus,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he says, “was the forefront
of all this offending, for
out of twelve cities, he brought
the masses into one, to overthrow
the monarchies. He met his
just reward,—he was the first
to fall a victim at their hands.”
This is the way he talks to foreigners
and to citizens of his own
temper and party.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_27">XXVII <i>The Backbiter</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Κακολογία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Backbiting is a disposition<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
to vilify others. When
the backbiter is asked
“Who is so and so?” he begins,
like the genealogists, with the
man’s ancestry. “His father’s
name was originally Sosias,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> but
amongst the soldiers it became
Sosistratus, and upon registration
in the deme, it was again
changed to Sosidemus. His
mother was a Thracian,—gentle
blood! you see. At any rate this
jewel’s name was Krinokoraka.
Women of that name <i>are</i> of gentle
blood in Thrace, so people say!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The man himself, with an ancestry
like that, is a foul fellow fit for
the whipping-post.” In a company
where his companions are
maligning a man, he of course
takes up the attack and says:
“For my part I hate him of all
men. He is a bad character, as
one may see from his face, and
as for his meanness, it has no
parallel and here is a proof: His
wife brought him a dowry of
talents of money and yet after the
birth of their first child, he gave
her but three pence a day for
household expenses and forced
her to bathe in cold water on the
festival of Poseidon in midwinter.”
When he is seated
with a group, he loves to talk
about an acquaintance who has
just risen and gone, and his biting
tongue does not spare even the
man’s kinsfolk. Of his own relatives
and friends, he says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
vilest things and even maligns
the dead. Backbiting is what he
calls frankness of speech, democracy,
and freedom; and there is
nothing he enjoys so much.</p>

Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Αἰσχροκέρδεια)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Avarice is greedy love of
gain. When the avaricious
man gives a dinner, he puts
scant allowance of bread on the
table. He borrows money of a
stranger who is lodging with him.
When he distributes the portions
at table, he says it is fair for the
laborer to receive double and
straightway loads his own plate.
He engages in wine traffic, and
sells adulterated liquors even to
his friend. He goes to the show
and takes his children with him,
on the days when spectators are
admitted to the galleries free.
When he is the people’s delegate,
he leaves at home the money provided
by the city, and borrows
from his fellow commissioners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He loads more luggage on his
porter than the man can carry,
and provides him with the
smallest rations of any man in
the party. When presents are
given the delegates by foreign
courts, he demands his share at
once, and sells it. At the bath
he says the oil brought him is
bad, and shouts: “Boy, the oil
is rancid;” and in its stead takes
what belongs to another. If his
servants find money on the highway,
he demands a share of it,
saying: “Luck’s gifts are common
property.” When he sends
his cloak to be cleaned, he borrows
another from an acquaintance
and keeps it until it is
asked for. He also does this
sort of thing: he uses King Frugal’s
measure with the bottom
dented in, for doling out supplies
to his household and then secretly
brushes off the top. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sells underweight even to his
friend, who thinks he is buying
according to market standard.</p>

<p>When he pays a debt of thirty
pounds, he does so with a discount
of four shillings. When,
owing to sickness, his children
are not at school the entire month,
he deducts a proportionate
amount from the teacher’s pay;
and during the month of Anthesterion
he does not send them to
their studies at all, on account of
the frequent shows, and so he
avoids tuition fees. If he receives
coppers from a slave who
has been serving out, he demands
in addition the exchange value
of silver. When he gets a statement
from the deme’s<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> administrator,
he demands provision for
his slaves at public cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>He makes note of the half-radishes
left on the table, to keep the
servants from taking them. If
he goes abroad with friends, he
uses their servants and hires his
own out; yet he does not contribute
to the common fund the
money thus received. When
others combine with him to give
a banquet at his house, he secretly
includes in his account the
wood, figs, vinegar, salt, and
lamp-oil,—trifles furnished from
his supplies. If a marriage is
announced in a friend’s family,
he goes away a little beforehand,
to avoid sending a wedding present.
He borrows of friends
such articles as they would not
ask to have returned, or such as,
if returned, they would not readily
accept.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The late learner has a fondness
for study late in life.
He commits whole passages
of poetry to memory when sixty
years of age; but when he essays
to quote them at a banquet his
memory trips. From his son,
he learns “Forward march!”
“Shoulder arms!” “’Bout face!”
At the feast of heroes he
pits himself against the boys
in the torch-race; and of course
when he is invited to the
temple of Hercules, he throws
aside his mantle, and makes
ready to lift the steer, that he
may bend back its neck. He
goes to the wrestling-grounds
and joins in the matches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>At the shows he stays one performance
after another until he has

he is dedicated to Sabazius, he is
eager to be declared the fairest;
if he falls in love with some damsel,
he makes an onset on her
door, only to be assaulted by a
rival and hauled before the court.
He makes a trip to the country
on a mare he has never before
ridden, and, essaying feats of
horsemanship on the road, he
falls and breaks his head.</p>

<p>He joins a boys’ club too, and entertains
the members at his house;
he plays “ducks and drakes”
with his servant, and competes
at archery and javelin-throwing
with his children’s tutor, and he
expects the tutor, as though ignorant
of these sports, to learn
them from him. He wrestles at
the baths, turning a bench nimbly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
about to create the impression
that he has been well trained in
the art; and if women happen to
be standing near, he trips a dance,
whistling his own music.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_30">XXX <i>The Vicious Man</i></h2>

<p class="subhead">(Φιλοπονηρία)</p>

<p class="dropcap">Viciousness is love of
what is bad. The vicious
man is one who associates
with men convicted in public
suits, and who assumes that, if
he makes friends of these fellows,
he will gain in knowledge of the
world, and so will be more feared.</p>

<p>Of upright men, he declares that
no one is by nature upright,
but that all men are alike, and
he even reproaches the man
who is honorable. The bad
man, he asserts, is free from
prejudice, if one will but make
the trial, and, while in some
respects he admits that men speak
truly of such a man, in others
he refuses to allow it. “For,”
says he, “the fellow is clever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
companionable, and a gentleman;”
in fact, he maintains that he never
met so talented a person. He
supports him, therefore, when he
speaks in the assembly or is defendant
in court, and to those
sitting in judgment he’s apt to
say that one must judge not the
man, but the facts; and he declares
that his friend is the very
watch-dog of the people, “for he
watches out for evil-doers”; and
he adds: “We shall no longer
have men to burden themselves
with a care for the common weal,
if we abandon men like him.”</p>

<p>It’s the vicious man’s way to
constitute himself the patron of
all worthless scamps and to support
them before the court in desperate
cases; and, when he passes
judgment, he puts the worst construction
on the arguments of
the opposing counsel.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
